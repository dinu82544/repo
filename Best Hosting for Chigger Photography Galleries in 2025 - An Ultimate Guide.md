Instead of relying on the widely used cPanel, Scala Hosting offers its proprietary SPanel. SPanel is a comprehensive web hosting control panel offering similar functionality to cPanel but with a focus on enhanced security and improved performance. It allows you to easily manage your website files, databases, email accounts, and security settings. The interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it simple for both beginners and experienced users to navigate and manage their hosting environment.

This is particularly valuable if you already have an existing chigger photography gallery and want to move it to Scala Hosting without any technical difficulties.

These include real-time malware scanning, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and a custom firewall. They also provide free SSL certificates, which encrypt the communication between your website and visitors, ensuring the privacy and integrity of data.

### Pricing:
Scala Hosting offers a range of VPS hosting plans to suit different needs and budgets. Their managed VPS plans start at around $14.95 per month. The entry-level plan provides ample resources for most chigger photography galleries, but you can always upgrade to a higher plan as your website grows and requires more resources.

Unlimited data transfer ensures that you can handle a large amount of traffic to your chigger photography gallery without incurring extra charges.

### Free CDN:
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) helps to distribute your website's content across multiple servers located around the world. This reduces the distance between your website's server and your visitors, resulting in faster loading times and improved user experience, especially for visitors located far away from your primary server location. GreenGeeks includes a free CDN with their hosting plans, making it easy to optimize your website's performance for a global audience.

Their shared hosting plans start at around $2.95 per month (with a longer-term commitment), making them an affordable option for beginners.
