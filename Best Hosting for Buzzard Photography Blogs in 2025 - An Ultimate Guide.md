Security is paramount, especially for websites containing valuable visual content. Scala Hosting employs a multi-layered security approach, including real-time threat detection, firewalls, and malware scanning. These measures protect your website from cyber threats and ensure the integrity of your data.

### Pricing and Plans:
Scala Hosting offers a range of VPS and shared hosting plans to suit different needs and budgets. Shared hosting plans are perfect for smaller blogs starting at very affordable rates.
